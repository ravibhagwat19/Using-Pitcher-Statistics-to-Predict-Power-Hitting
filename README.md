# Using-Pitcher-Statistics-to-Predict-Power-Hitting
Major league baseball shattered the previous homerun record in 2019 with 6,776 homeruns, a mark that was 11% higher than the previous record, and 21% higher than the total in 2018. As the MLB progresses forward, prioritizing the homerun has become common place for most major league offenses. This trend is not new, however. Homeruns have been steadily increasing since the origins of professional baseball, and have hit a sharp incline in the last 5 years alongside Statcast data tracking. The desire for the longball is not unfounded however. Homeruns have a significant impact on runs scored, and are correlated with higher winning percentages among teams that hit more homeruns.
